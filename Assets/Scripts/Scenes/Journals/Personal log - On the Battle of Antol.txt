For 150 years of the war the Antolics did manage to stay neutral. But everything changed after massive bombings of the Antolic home planet occured. The planet of Antol came under significant attack by Mentorian forces who made planetfall in several sectors. A quick counterattack by the Antolic Navy cut off the invading ground troops who were then mopped up by the planetary defense forces.  Everybody was quick to blame the Mentorians and their warrior mindset for the attack. But the Antolics' government had doubts about us humans too... And I think the doubts were justified. But I am a soldier. My mission is not to think back at history. My mission is to act.
