They approched me with a deal that was too sweet to be turned down. A chance to win the war? The casualties with this new weapon would be in the millions but those Mentorians deserve it, and we won't be dependent to those slimy Antolics either. Both are savages ! I accepted the deal. We will get a private escort until we get to our destination. I told my men that we are transporting medical supplies and I have arranged for some supplies of the sort to be brought aboard. Some of them were sceptical but they all accepted the mission. I am proud to serve the human race!
