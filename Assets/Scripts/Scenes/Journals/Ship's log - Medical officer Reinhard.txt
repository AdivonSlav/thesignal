They told us we were transporting medical suppplies to the northen front... But everything felt strange right from the beginning. We got a whole military escort with us, through our own territory. The captain received his orders for this mission right from the top brass of Army HQ. We knew it was not just medicine. But I could not imagine this... I wonder if it was worth the blood... My comrades are dead... The weapon is probably stolen and my life is coming to an end... I miss my family... I hope that one day they will live in a world without war, a world without this meaningless death... A world without the Mentorians.
