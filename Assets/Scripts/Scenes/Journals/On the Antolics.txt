The Antolics are a proud race. Very similar to humans in fact. We first made contact with them over 500 years ago. We shared technology, traded, exchanged diplomatic missions and embassies,  but the trust was never fully there. Espionage was rampant and mutual.  Antolic foreign policy intensified with the Mentorian war against us. The Mentorians attacked our northern colonies, murdering millions of humans and thousand of other races. The Antolics wanted to be mediators  by calming both sides down and keeping themselves out of the conflict. However, this proved to be a fool man's errand and no indication of a ceasefire or peace has emerged so far.
